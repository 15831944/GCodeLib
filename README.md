## GCodeLib

This repo contains GCode-related utilities. Currently it's a light prototype of GCode parser and interpreter. It's not intended to strictly comply any existing GCode standards or particular implementations, the aim is processing GCode programms generated by the most popular tools. For the sake of minimal compatibility I'm using RepRap wiki and LinuxCNC documentation as information sources. It's planned to implement some LinuxCNC-specific features. The main project motivation is providing appropriate GCode utilities for my mini-CNC project.

Current project goals:
* provide GCode parser which is
  * capable to process GCode generated by the most popular tools.
  * has error-detecting capabilities.
  * include some additional flow control and storage-related features.
  * generate simple intermediate code which include hardware-dependent and common (flow control, variables, mathematical and logical operation) instructions.
* provide GCode interpreter framework which is able to execute hardware-independent instructions directly and pass hardware-dependent instructions to library user.
